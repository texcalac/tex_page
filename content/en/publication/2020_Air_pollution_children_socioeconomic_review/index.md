abstract: "Objectives: Air pollution is a leading environmental risk, and socioeconomic status (SES) is postulated as an effect modifier, especially in children. There is a growing interest in exploring this modifier. The present manuscript reviews SES as an effect modifier in children's respiratory health.
Methods: A search in the PubMed and SCOPUS databases was conducted in September 2017 to identify studies with the inclusion criteria of being centred on children, respiratory outcomes, air pollutants and SES measurement.
Results: A total of 17 studies were included. Twelve used single SES variables, and the remaining studies included composite SES indices. Household income (9) and parental education (8) were frequently evaluated. The significance of the effect modifier was found in nine studies that demonstrated a higher risk for individuals living in a lower SES. Sources of heterogeneity included SES measurement, health outcomes and geographical aggregation.
Conclusions: The results suggest a higher modification in the effect of SES, generally indicating greater risk for children in lower SES. Children's characteristics need to be more carefully theorized and measured in this area, including the use of transdisciplinary approaches."
