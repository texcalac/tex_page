abstract: Exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with the prevalence of obesity. In the Greater Mexico City Area (GMCA), both are ranked among the highest in the world. Our aim was to analyze this association in children, adolescents, and adults in the GMCA. We used data from the 2006 and 2012 Mexican National Surveys of Health and Nutrition (ENSANUT). Participants’ past-year exposure to ambient PM2.5 was assessed using land use terms and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth estimates; weight and height were measured. We used survey-adjusted logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of obesity (vs. normal-overweight) for every 10 µg/m3 increase in annual PM2.5 exposure for children, adolescents, and adults. Using a meta-analysis approach, we estimated the overall odds of obesity. We analyzed data representing 19.3 million and 20.9 million GMCA individuals from ENSANUT 2006 and 2012, respectively. The overall pooled estimate between PM2.5 exposure and obesity was OR = 1.96 (95% CI 1.21, 3.18). For adolescents, a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an OR of 3.53 (95% CI 1.45, 8.58) and 3.79 (95% CI 1.40, 10.24) in 2006 and 2012, respectively. More studies such as this are recommended in Latin American cities with similar air pollution and obesity conditions.
